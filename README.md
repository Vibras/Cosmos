# Cosmos
**Description:** Cosmos enables the iPad-exclusive PictureInPicture feature to jailbroken iPods, and iPhones, and all other iPads running iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11 devices that aren't one of the newer iPad models (such as the ones like the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, iPad Pro 9.7 inch, etc.).

**Repo for install**: See my (personal) Cydia repo (http://chasefromm17.yourepo.com) for more info.

**Tested on the following devices**: Two iPod touch 5G models - both running iOS 9.3.5 (and also, one of them ran iOS 9.3.1 at one point in time, and I tested that it worked at that time as well, so I can for a fac say that it works on there as well), two iPhone 4S models (one of them currently is broken, *sad face/unfortunate face* - ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜•) - both running iOS 9.3.5. Also tested on ARM64-bit devices too: being tested on an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, an iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 9.3.2, an iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3.2, two iPhone 5 models on iOS 10.3.3 (and one other on iOS 10.3.2), and an iPhone SE on iOS 11.0.3, etc.
