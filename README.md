# Cosmos
Cosmos enables the iPad-exclusive PictureInPicture feature to jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices that aren't one of the newer iPad models (such as the ones like the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, etc.). See my (personal) Cydia repo (chasefromm17.yourepo.com) for more info. Tested on an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.1.1 (thanks @CydiaGeek!), an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, an iPod touch 5G running iOS 9.3.5, an iPhone 4S running iOS 9.3.5, and an iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 9.3.2.
