# Cosmos
Cosmos enables the iPad-exclusive PictureInPicture feature to jailbroken iPods, and iPhones, and all other iPads running iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11 devices that aren't one of the newer iPad models (such as the ones like the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, iPad Pro 9.7 inch, etc.).

**Repo**: See my (personal) Cydia repo (chasefromm17.yourepo.com) for more info.
