# Cosmos
**Description:** Cosmos enables the iPad-exclusive PictureInPicture feature to jailbroken iPods, and iPhones, and all other iPads running iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11 devices that aren't one of the newer iPad models (such as the ones like the iPad Pro 12.9 inch, iPad Pro 9.7 inch, etc.).

**Repo for install**: See my (personal) Cydia repo (chasefromm17.yourepo.com) for more info.

**Tested on the following devices**: Tested on an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.2, two iPod touch 5G models - both running iOS 9.3.5 (and I believe one of them ran iOS 9.3.1 at one point in time, so I can confirm it works there as well), an iPhone 4S running iOS 9.3.5, an iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 9.3.2, an iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3.2, two iPhone 5 models on iOS 10.3.3 (and one other on iOS 10.3.2), an iPhone SE on iOS 11.0.3, etc.
